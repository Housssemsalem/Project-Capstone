This capstone project course gave me a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. In this course i took the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.   

I was tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore if we can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. And thanks to the findings of this data sience project and models, the competing startup I have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
